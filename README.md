# Learning LZW compression algorithm

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

## Notes

"[Unlike Huffman Encoding, LZW doesnâ€™t require this dictionary to be included in the compressed data. One of the unique characteristics of this algorithm is that this dictionary can be rebuilt while uncompressing the data](https://hackernoon.com/unixs-lzw-compression-algorithm-how-does-it-work-cp65347h#NyWBLTdXEqWi5eDwzGGi:~:text=Unlike%20Huffman%20Encoding%2C%20LZW%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20require,be%20rebuilt%20while%20uncompressing%20the%20data.), ... [with the 256 ASCII codes as a preliminary step](https://hackernoon.com/unixs-lzw-compression-algorithm-how-does-it-work-cp65347h#NyWBLTdXEqWi5eDwzGGi:~:text=with%20the%20256%20ASCII%20codes%20as%20a%20preliminary%20step)." LZW can be implemented with variable-width encoding. A maximum width would then be used to put a cap on memory consumption, so once the dictionary is "filled", no more words can be added. LZW works better on data that has redundancy.

## Pseudocode

```python
def lzw(input: array):
    output = compressed_data
    dictionary.pre_filled_with(basic_ascii_chars)
    for word in input:
        if word in dictionary:
            output.add(dictionary[word])
        elif dictionary.is_full():
            output.add(word)
        else: # not in dictionary and dictionary has space
            dictionary.add(word)
            output.add(dictionary[word])
    return output
```

## Running the code in this repo

```bash
python encode_lzw.py # example_text.txt -> example_text.lzw
python decode_lzw.py # example_text.lzw -> example_text_decoded.txt
```
